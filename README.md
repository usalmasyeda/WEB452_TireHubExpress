# WEB452_TireHubExpress

Product Description:
The WEB452 project for Fall 2023 revolves around building a website for a specific product.
and the chosen product is 'Tire.' This project, based on Microsoft's tutorial, is crafted using 
ASP.NET MVC with ASP.NET Core, showcasing a dynamic and user-friendly web development approach.

I was given the task of researching "tire" products and the existing companies that sell tires as their product.
My job involved studying competitors' websites, understanding tire attributes, and summarizing 
this information for my application. After examining various tire-related websites, I collected 
crucial insights and then defined the key features and characteristics of the tire application.

I chose the brand name "TireHubExpress" for my application and built it using ASP.NET Core, despite 
it being an older version (3.0.0). I used Microsoft Visual Studio Code (2019) for development, and I 
integrated my GitHub account to ensure secure collaboration and easy version control. I started by 
creating a controller for database interactions and user-friendly views, including a tire catalog and 
"About Us" section with visuals and detailed information I organized the project structure with models, 
added initial data to describe tire properties and implemented validation rules for data accuracy. 

Lastly, I improved the visual appeal by customizing fonts and using CSS styles to make the application
more user-friendly and visually appealing. Each step aimed at creating a functional and user-friendly 
application for a smooth user experience.

More details about this step-by-step application are in the README.txt file.
